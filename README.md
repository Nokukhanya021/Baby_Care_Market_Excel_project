# Baby_Care_Market_Excel_project
The Baby Care Market Excel project is about analyzing real-world FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) data to understand how different products perform over time. 
The project focuses on building a structured, interactive Excel report that gives management a 360-degree view of business performance. By examining brands, package types, package sizes, and stock keeping units (SKUs), the report helps track industry trends and uncover detailed insights at lower breakdown levels.
In this project, I will be cleaning and preparing raw data (data preprocessing), creating pivot tables to summarize performance, and adding slicers to make the report interactive.I will design a flexible dashboard that allows managers to filter, drill down, and compare results across multiple dimensions.

##  Objectives
- Transform raw FMCG data into a clean, structured dataset and ready for analysis
- Build pivot tables to summarize performance across multiple dimensions(brand, package type, SKU, etc.).
- Add slicers for interactive filtering and flexible reporting, allowing managers to filter and drill down into specific details.
- Provide actionable insights for management decision-making.
- Strengthen Excel skills in data preprocessing, reporting, and analysis.

## Project Workflow
1. Task 1: Data Preprocessing
   Clean and prepare raw datasets (remove duplicates, handle missing values, standardize formats).  
2. Task 2: Primary Report Table Structure
   Build pivot tables with fields for brands, package types, SKUs, and time periods.  
3. Task 3: Fill in the Report
   Populate pivot tables, add calculated fields, and format for readability.  
4. Task 4: Insert Slicers
   Add slicers to filter by brand, package type, size, SKU, or time period.  
5. Task 5: Interpretation
   Analyze results, identify trends, and highlight insights for management.
